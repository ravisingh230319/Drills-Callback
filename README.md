# Drills-Callback
In this project we have do the find out some information from the files using callbacks and see how harder it becomes when we use callbacks inside callback function to under callback hell.

The input folder have 3 files on which we need to perform some operations:-

    Boards have ids and names
    Lists belong to boards
    Cards belong to lists

## Problems needed to find out
The following informations needed to be calculated in this project:-

Problem 1: Return a particular board's information based on the boardID that is passed from the given list of boards in boards.json.
 
Problem 2: Return all lists that belong to a board based on the boardID that is passed to it from the given data in lists.json. 
 
Problem 3: Return all cards that belong to a particular list based on the listID that is passed to it from the given data in cards.json. 

Problem 4: Use the previously written functions to get the following information. 

    Get information from the Thanos boards
    Get all the lists for the Thanos board
    Get all cards for the Mind list simultaneously


Problem 5: Use the previously written functions to get the following information. 

    Get information from the Thanos boards
    Get all the lists for the Thanos board
    Get all cards for the Mind and Space lists simultaneously
